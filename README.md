django-request is a statistics module for django. It stores requests in a database for admins to see, it can also be used to get statistics on who is online etc.

As well as a site statistics module, with the active_users template tag and manager method you can also use django-request to show who is online in a certain time.

    Request.objects.active_users(minutes=15)

To find the request overview page, please click on Requests inside the admin, then “Overview” on the top right, next to “add”.

Installation
------------

- Put `'request'` in your INSTALLED_APPS setting.
- Run the command `manage.py syncdb`.
- Add `request.middleware.RequestMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`. If you use `django.contrib.auth`, place the RequestMiddleware after it. If you use `django.contrib.flatpages` place `request.middleware.RequestMiddleware` before it else flatpages will be marked as error pages in the admin panel.
- Make sure that the domain name in django.contrib.sites admin is correct. This is used to calculate unique visitors and top referrers.
