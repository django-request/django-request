Quick start guide
=================

.. note::

    To find the request overview page, please click on Requests inside the admin, then "Overview" on the top right, next to "add".

Once you have installed ``django-request`` you can add it to a django project by following these steps;

	#. Install the blog app by adding ``'request'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

	#. Run ``manage.py syncdb`` so that Django will create the database tables.

	#. Add ``request.middleware.RequestMiddleware`` to ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``. If you use django.contrib.auth, place RequestMiddleware after it. If you use django.contrib.flatpages place ``request.middleware.RequestMiddleware`` before it else flatpages will be marked as error pages in the admin panel.

	#. Make sure that the domain name in django.contrib.sites admin is correct. This is used to calculate unique visitors and top referrers.
